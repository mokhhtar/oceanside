    <p>Living in Oceanside comes with perks: the beach, the breeze, and the endless sun. But let's be honest, the "coastal lifestyle" can be brutal on your hair. The combination of salt air, hard water, and UV rays often leaves hair feeling more like straw than silk.</p>
    
    <p>How do you know if your hair is just having a bad day or if it's crying out for professional help? Here are the 5 unmistakable signs.</p>

    <h2>1. The "Frizz Halo" Won't Go Away</h2>
    <p>If you step outside and your hair immediately expands due to humidity, your cuticles are likely raised and dry. A simple conditioner isn't enough here; you need a keratin smoothing treatment to seal the moisture in.</p>

    <h2>2. Your Hair Tangels Instantly</h2>
    <p>Does the ocean breeze turn your hair into a bird's nest? Healthy hair has a smooth surface that slides against itself. Damaged hair catches and knots. This is a classic sign of protein deficiency caused by sun exposure.</p>

    <h2>3. Color Fading Too Fast</h2>
    <p>If that expensive balayage you got two weeks ago already looks brassy or dull, the culprit is likely oxidation from the sun and salt. A gloss treatment can restore vibrancy and add a protective UV shield.</p>

    <h2>4. Brittle Ends</h2>
    <p>Take a look at the ends of your hair. Do they split or snap off easily? Saltwater is dehydrating. Without regular deep hydration masks, your ends will keep breaking, making it impossible to grow your length.</p>

    <h2>5. Lack of Shine</h2>
    <p>Healthy hair reflects light. Damaged hair absorbs it. If your hair looks matte and dull even after washing, it's time for a professional shine treatment to restore its natural luster.</p>
